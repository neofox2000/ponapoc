  description: Umbrans are said to be the descendants of the Goddess Umbra.  Typically
    they look like any other equine, but they have a horn on their forehead that allows
    them to tap into the mysterious forces of magic.  Umbrans have a tendancy to be
    slightly more intelligent than their Auran and Gaian cousins.
