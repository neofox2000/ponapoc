    Sugar never changes.

    Except for when it runs out... that''s a pretty big change.


    We mined every deposit, on and off shore.

    We accused other nations of hoarding while we did just that.


    Everyone thought the world would end in fire, bombs dropping out of the sky on
    unsuspecting cities...


    It was worse.


    There were no air raid sirens.  No calls to stay in-doors and wait for further
    instructions.  Just a quiet squirrelling away of a few bright minds and many loyal
    or desperate labourers.


    Everyone else, well...


    It''s been 40 years since the slow, suffering decline of civilization.  We join
    an unlikely heroine as she ventures forth from her home; a stadium-turned-shelter
    meant to keep those inside safe from the horrors beyond its reinforced walls.



    [Dev Note: A prequel is still under construction to set the stage for leaving
    the starting area, so for now we''re just going to dump you into a later stage]'
