### Left off at ###
- Items in an inventory need unique identifiers to avoid probably switching between the same weapon model with different ammo in it

	* Add blurbs and debuffs at every 20% increment of contimation
	* Add bad ending when contamination reaches 100%
- Balance AI weapon damage

- Fix Launcher weapon types

	(colliders for zones that change lighting when player touches them)
- Research tweening for lighting transitions
- Add a way to see the details of the Status Effects that are currently applied to the player


### GUI ###
- Maximum HP/MP/SP shown on character sheet should be more explicitly labeled as such
- Quick-help bars need better context info updates


### Melee Weapon Overhaul ###
- Apply skill modifiers to AP consumption on melee attacks
- Add more combos and/or alter animations
- Make new and existing mix hit different heights, instead of just hitting mid-height always


### Controller support ###
- Add controller buttons for moving more than 1 item at a time on inventory screens
- Change other stats to be selectables (allows controller to highlight them)


### AI Stuff ###
? Prevent AI from getting stuck while in fear or seek states
- Allow AI to following targets through doors?
- Add 2D pathfinding functions in the BaseController class (for both AI and cinemtic purposes)
- Change AI handling to ActionQueue-based instead of timer-based
? Add AI toggle for picking up loot (allows player to use items as bait)


### Abilities ###
- Add at least 2 offensive abilities
- Add abilities feature
	M Increase ability practice exp/levels as they are used
	T Add benifits for increase practice/theory levels
	- Add sound/visual for ability level increases
	* Add support for item requirement/consumption for abilities
	^ Modify character creation process to apply starting abilities?
		** What if the first ability is learned in the turoial section?
			*** It would need to be added if the tutorial/intro is skipped
=== OR ===
- Scrap (active) ability system?


### Skills ###
- Armor skills should reduce carry weight of equipped armor
- Alchemy skill should reduce relevant items' carry weight
- Alchemy skill should add chance to find extra relevant item drops


### Character Creation ###
- Add presets


### World Map ###
- Terrain system uses way too much memory, need to swap back to sprite maps
- Update player marker art


### Mission ###
- NPC trader re-seeding will need to be figured out after trading inventory is made persistant
- Misclicked consumables are used unintentially; add a 2nd click requirement to actually use them
- Quest Tracker?
- Barter screen hides Trader's haggle responses
- Transitioning from sneak to normal shooting an automatic weapon puts muzzle in the air
- During conversations, if the speaker is too close to the edge of the stage, it is possible (briefly) see outside of the play area


### Balancing ###
- Set better loot tables for mobs (rely less on mob loot)
- Add more designed loot to Maresville (new gun in secret place, ammo caches, etc)
- Find a way to make scavenging skill work with new loot table systems


### Notes ###
- Potential persistent mission data to save:
	= Storage Containers
		* State (normal, smashed, hidden, etc)

	= Player
		* Last Mission visited (prevent players from re-entering Last Hope to regen trader items?)

	= NPCs
		* Present or not (based on quest states)

	= Quest Triggers [this can be calculated on the fly based on quest requirements/conditions]
		* State (Dormant, Active, Triggered)

	= Missions
		* Firstrun (yes/no)
		* Remaining enemy count (only for Returning state on procedurally generated missions)
		* Boss state data (later when we add bosses) (could also be calculated based on quest conditions?)

	= Generic objects
		* The state of random things like doorways that could become destroyed or blocked
		* State of traps designed into the missions
		* State of traps placed by player?


### Feedback / Bugs ###
- Tutorial mobs need to spawn off-screen to avoid breaking immersion
- When using a controller, if the mouse is in a position that overlaps dialog options, they will be highlighted and confuse the player
- Skill list is sorted differently in character creation screen and missions
- World map controller input could use some additional redundant buttons for travelling
- World map controller input needs a crosshair to show where you will travel when you hit the button
- Barter balance still confuses people
- Setup Dialog to say different lines based on player's Gender
- Broken Bits needs his own dialog when talking to him in Last Hope
- Level up event goes unnoticed by many players
	* Add a list of level-up blurbs that the player could say
- Need destructible objects (explody barrels?)
- hard to see what is equipped/selected
- GUI sounds too loud and clicky
- GUI buttons don't make sound on mouse click
- +/- buttons in skills should change skill rapidly when held
- Can't see the water in the sewers now (add personal lighting?)
- Weapon muzzle positions are being incorrectly offset by camera zoom distance
